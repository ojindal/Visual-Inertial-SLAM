Implemented visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) in Python. Provided data: Synchronized measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a stereo camera and the intrinsic camera calibration and the extrinsic calibration between the two sensors, specifying the transformation from the IMU to the left camera frame.

There are total four code files(.py format):

1. pr3_utils.py
2. part_a.py
3. part_b.py
4. part_c.py

- First one is an extension of the already given files as I added some small small functions.

- Second one contains solution of part(a) - IMU Localization via EKF Prediction.

- Third one contains solution of part(b) - Landmark Mapping via EKF Update.

- Fourth one contains solution of part(c) - Visual SLAM.
